DoodleKit
=========

Social drawing for iOS devices.

DoodleKit manages up to four users drawings on a single canvas, allowing doodlers to create and share content across their devices.

This is a drop-in framework that handles the drawing and p2p networking for you without any dependency on GameKit UI. In fact, we highly recommend that you avoid GameKit as much as possible.

A demo app, Doodle Party, is included in the repository.

Developed with care and exhaustion at [iOSDevCamp 2013](http://iosdevcamp.org "iOSDevCamp").
